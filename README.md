(Required)
🎯 Please mention the requirements you met and which goals you achieved for this assignment.

I achieved all goals and requirements:
User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want to be able to click the cookie and increment the counter
🐿️ As a user, I want to see the counter automatically increment using an interval timer
🐿️ As a user, I want to purchase items i can afford in the shop and increase the number of cookies every time the interval passes
Requirements
🎯 Create state variables to store the current number of cookies and the cookies PerSecond value (useState)

🎯 Set up a timer to increment the number of cookies by the cookiesPerSecond value (useEffect). Be sure to handle clearing the timer using the useEffect return value.

🎯 Set up an array of objects containing the items available for purchase in the store, their cost and their increment increase value. Map through these and create buttons for each.

🎯 Create a function to handle the purchase of an item. This should check if the user has enough cookies to purchase the item, and if so, subtract the cost of the item from the number of cookies and add the increment value to the cookiesPerSecond value.

I also wanted to recreate the clicker theme that I built for week two, and I'm happy with how this has improved upon it.



🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?

I attempted a stretch goal to use local storage but ran out of time, however I did incorporate some nice CSS and embedded an external Spotify song which I'm hoping might push it into stretch territory?

🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I found it tricky to fully comprehend which parts of the code could be moved into separate components, and which needed to remain in the app.jsx - and in turn, knowing which components needed to be re-linked across the multiple sections.

(Optional)
🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission e.g.
 
What went really well and what could have gone better?

I'm really happy with how the page looks and that the pink theme / chonky cat etc has been recreated based on my week two assignment. I'm also pleased that I have completed the assignment within the allocated time as I have a busy weekend coming up, so that has been a nice confidence boost!

Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment.

I had trouble with the final deployment as it did not carry over the button image, so this needed to be changed in the context of the clicker button. I also had a few errors which were in relation to calling functions multiple times, but this has been resolved.
